This repo is to create scripts to turn US Census Bureau shapefiles into R sp
objects for the 48 contiguous US states.

The US Census Bureau cartographic shapefiles are available here

* [County](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_counties.html)
* [State](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_state.html)

Each has boundary files in three resolutions

* 500k = 1:500,000
* 5m = 1:5,000,000
* 20m = 1:20,000,000

In addition to counties and states, we will create boundary files for commuting
zones. [Commuting
zones](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/commuting-zones-and-labor-market-areas/)
are comprised of one or more counties. We will make boundaries for the 1990
commuting zones as specified in this Excel spreadsheet

* [1980 and 1990 commuting zones and labor market
areas](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/Commuting_Zones_and_Labor_Market_Areas__17970/czlma903.xls?v=40961)

We will store the data in the WGS 84, EPSG:4326
([epsg.io](https://epsg.io/4326)) coordinate reference system.

Our naming convention is `cb_year_states_region_resolution.rds` where

* year = 2015
* states = contig, alaska, hawaii
* region = county, cz, state
* resolution = 500k, 5m, 20m
