Boundaries of US counties, commuting zones, and states in R sp format.

County and state boundaries are provided in three resolutions

* 500k = 1:500,000
* 5m = 1:5,000,000
* 20m = 1:20,000,000

All boundaries use the WGS 84, EPSG:4326 ([epsg.io](https://epsg.io/4326))
coordinate reference system.

The county and state boundary files have this naming convention:
`cb_year_us_region_resolution_format.rds` where

* year = 2015
* region = county, state
* resolution = 500k, 5m, 20m
* format = sp

The commuting zone boundary files have this naming convention:
`cb_year_us_cz_format.rds` where

* year = 1990
* format = sp
